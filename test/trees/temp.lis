Dear Umesh, 
  since I will be unable to go to CERN to work on the DB, we will try to fix the requested additions 
with me working in Milano, you at FNAL and Marco at CERN.

These are the variables we would like you to add to the DB:

   Quantity        Default   Variable/Column Name

Trigger holdoff      0      "TriggerHoldoff"
"busyWhenBehind"     4      "BusyWhenBehind"
auto-clear-busy      1      "FeatureRegister"

FIFO2 almost full  0x1c00   "FIFO2Limit"
TimoutOROOS limit     -     "TimeoutOROOSLimit"

SPARE1		            "SPARE1"
SPARE2                      "SPARE2" 
SPARE3                      "SPARE3" 
SPARE4                      "SPARE4" 
SPARE5                      "SPARE5" 
SPARE6                      "SPARE6" 
SPARE7                      "SPARE7" 
SPARE8                      "SPARE8" 
SPARE9                      "SPARE9" 
SPARE10                     "SPARE10"

The Column Name is what you should add (if you need to, please capitalize all characters in the name). 
Please be consistent in adding exactly the names we indicate here above.

These columns should be added to the following TABLE (depending upon the DV version, development or production):

For development:  cms_pxl_int2r_lb -> "CMS_PXL_PIXEL_VIEW_OWNER.CONF_KEY_FED_CONFIGURATION_V" 

For production :  cms_omds_nolb    -> "CMS_PXL_PIXEL_VIEW.CONF_KEY_FED_CONFIGURATION_V"

Others         :  cms_omds_lb      -> "CMS_PXL_PIXEL_VIEW.CONF_KEY_FED_CONFIGURATION_V"
                  cmsdevr_nolb     -> "CMS_PXL_PIXEL_VIEW.CONF_KEY_FED_CONFIGURATION_V" 
                  
              
Let us know when you're done, so that we can proceed to add corrections to the existing DB interface and to the GUI.

Dario & Marco
